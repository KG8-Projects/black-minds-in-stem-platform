Balloon-Powered Car Challenge,"Do you think you could build a car powered by nothing but air? A balloon-powered car is pushed forward by air escaping from a balloon, and it is fun and easy to build with materials you already have around your house. Can you imagine how you would want your own balloon-powered car to look? Can you design a car that will travel as far as possible?  You can even measure your car's speed using your smartphone and a special sensor app. Get ready to grab some simple supplies to bring your idea to lif",https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project-ideas/Phys_p099/physics/balloon-powered-car-challenge,Science Buddies,Science Project,"Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science, Environmental Science",K-5,$20 ,Online,5 days,Advanced,Medium,,Low,FALSE,Any,Equipment,Under-$100,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,High,TRUE,FALSE,Basic,National,Required,TRUE,Professional

See Air Currents with Shadowgraphs and Schlieren Images,"Have you ever wondered what the air currents look like around a candle? What about cold air flowing around an ice cube, or warm air rising from your hand? What about when you sneeze? We are surrounded by air currents all the time, but these subtle movements are completely invisible to the human eye. In this science project, you will take advantage of small changes in air density to make air currents visible in regular photographs and videos, using techniques called shadowgraphy and schlieren ima",https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project-ideas/Photo_p027/photography-digital-photography-video/shadowgraphs-and-schlieren-images,Science Buddies,Science Project,"Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science, Environmental Science",K-5,$50+,Online,10 days,Advanced,Medium,,Medium,FALSE,Middle+,Equipment,Under-$100,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,High,TRUE,FALSE,Basic,National,Required,TRUE,Professional
